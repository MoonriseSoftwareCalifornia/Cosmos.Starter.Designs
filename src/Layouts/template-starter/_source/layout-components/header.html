      Defines the code that should appear at the very top of each page.

      Please note:
          * Only put in this file the code that should appear at the
            head of every page on your website.
          * If you are using Cosmos CMS' built-in dynamic navigation tool, which 
            depends on bootstrap, add the following code within the nav bar:
            
            <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarExample01" crx="true">
                <!-- {COSMOS-UL-NAV} ->
            </div>

          * Use of the navigation tools is optional! If you don't use bootstrap,
            then don't use this option.
